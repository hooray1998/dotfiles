# Nvimpager

Using [neovim] as a pager to view man pages, git diffs, whatnot with neovim's
syntax highlighting and mouse support.

## About

The `nvimpager` script calls neovim in a fashion that turns it into something
like a pager.  The idea is not new, this is actually rewrite of [vimpager] but
with less (but stricter) dependencies and specifically for neovim.

Some typical use cases:

```sh
# view a file in nvimpager
nvimpager file
# pipe text to nvimpager
echo some text | nvimpager
# use it as your default $PAGER
export PAGER=nvimpager
man bash
git diff
```

The script also has a "cat mode" which will not start up the neovim interface
but instead print a highlighted version of the file to the terminal.  Like cat
with neovim syntax highlighting!  If the input has less lines than the terminal
cat mode is activated automatically so nvimpager behaves similar to `less -F`.
Pager mode and cat mode can be enforced with the options `-p` and `-c`
respectively.

Nvimpager comes with a small set of command line options but you can also use
all of neovim's command line options.  Use `nvimpager -h` to see the [help
text][options].  The configuration is separated from the users config for
neovim.  The main config file is `~/.config/nvimpager/init.vim`.  See [the
manpage][configuration] for further explanation.

## Technical stuff

### Dependencies

* [neovim] â‰¥ v0.3.0
* [bash]
* ([curl] during installation)
* ([busted] for running the tests)
* ([pandoc] to build the man page)

### Installation instructions

Use the makefile to install the script and its dependencies.  It supports the
usual `PREFIX` (defaults to `/usr/local`) and `DESTDIR` (defaults to empty)
variables:

```sh
make PREFIX=$HOME/.local install
```

### Development

Nvimpager is developed on [Github][nvimpager] where you are very much invited
to [post][issues] bug reports, feature or pull requests!  The test can be run
with `make test`.  They are also run on travis: [![Build Status]][travis]

#### Known Bugs (and non features)

* if reading from stdin, nvimpager (like nvim) waits for EOF until it starts up
* large files are slowing down neovim on startup (less does a better, i.e.
  faster and more memory efficient job at paging large files)

#### TODO and ideas list

* show a short message in the cmdline like less and vimpager do (file and help
  information)
* see how [neovim#7428](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/issues/7438) and
  [neovim#8246](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/issues/8246) are resolved and
  maybe move more code (logic) from bash to lua
* check if terminal buffers can be used to render ansi escape codes,
  alternatively ...
* check license options for bundling the AnsiEsc plugin, alternatively ...
* see if nvim_buf_add_highlight() can be used to do basically the same stuff
  that AnsiEsc does
* implement some more keybindings that make it behave more like less
* proper lazy pipe reading while paging (like less) to improve startup time and
  also memory usage for large input on pipes (maybe `stdioopen()` can be used?)
